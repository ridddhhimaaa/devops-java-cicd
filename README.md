Password Strength Analysis – Security Risk Scoring System

📖 Project Overview

This project is a **Java-based Password Strength Checker** integrated with **Data Science and Machine Learning analysis**, following **DevOps best practices**.

The system evaluates password strength using rule-based feature engineering, generates structured security data, performs exploratory data analysis and visualization using Python, and trains a machine learning model to classify password strength.

GitHub version control, branching, and merging are used to manage development workflows.

⚙️ Java Application Logic

The Java application performs the following steps:

1.Accepts password input from the user

2.Extracts password features:

-Length

-Uppercase characters

-Digits

-Special characters

3.Assigns weighted scores to each feature

4.Classifies password strength as:

-Weak

-Medium

-Strong

5.Stores results in a CSV file for analysis

🔢 Feature-Based Scoring (Example)

| Feature            | Weight |
| --------------------------- |
| Length             | 30     |
| Uppercase Letters  | 15     |
| Lowercase Letters  | 15     |
| Digits             | 20     |
| Special Characters | 20     |

▶️ Command Line Execution

The application is built and executed using Maven and the command line.

📊 Dataset Generation

Each execution appends one row to password_data.csv, which is later used for Data Science and Machine Learning analysis.

📈 Data Science & Visualization

The generated dataset is analyzed using Pandas and visualized using Matplotlib to understand password strength distribution and feature impact.

🤖 Machine Learning Model

-Model Used: Decision Tree Classifier

-Features: Length, uppercase, digit, special character, score

-Target: Password strength category

-Purpose: Predict password strength based on extracted features

This demonstrates how rule-based systems can be extended into predictive models.

🔀 DevOps Practices Used

-Git version control

-Separate branch for ML analysis (ml-analysis)

-Merging ML branch into main

-.gitignore to exclude build artifacts and checkpoints

-Clean commit history

🎓 Learning Outcomes
